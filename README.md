# Deep-learning-with-ResNet50

In this repo you will find the Matlab code from our manuscript with demonstration of Deep learning approach for comparison GFAP-labeled
astrocytes processes and GFP-labeled astrocyte surface in control astrocytes or after knockdown of Disc1 using convolutional deep neural
network ResNet50. 

The model was run in Matlab R2018b.

Images are available upon request.
