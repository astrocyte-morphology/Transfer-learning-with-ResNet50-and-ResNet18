# Transfer-learning-with-ResNet50-and-ResNet18

In this repo you will find the Matlab code from our manuscript with demonstration of Deep learning approach for comparison GFAP-labeled
astrocytes processes and GFP-labeled astrocyte surface in control astrocytes or after knockdown of Disc1 using convolutional deep neural
networks ResNet50 and ResNet18. 

We used cDNNs ResNet50 and ResNet18 with the following parameters and options: 1. Optimizer (optimization algorithm used for faster training and better performance of neural networks): SGDM (Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum; Qian, 1999) or ADAM (Adaptive Moment Estimation; Kingma & Ba, 2014); 2. Number of epochs = 8; 3. Learning rate: 0.0001; 4. Batch size: 10.

The model was run in Matlab R2018b.
